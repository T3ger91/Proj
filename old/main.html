    <h1>Main Game Rules</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Objective: The objective of the game is to navigate through a maze and reach the end point.</li>
      <li>Movement: The player can move in four directions - up, down, left, and right. The player can use the arrow keys or WASD keys to move.</li>
      <li>Obstacles: The maze will have walls that the player cannot pass through. If the player runs into a wall, they will have to turn and move in a different direction.</li>
      <li>End Point: The end point is marked by a special object that the player must reach in order to win the game.</li>
      <li>Timer: The game can be timed, so that the player has a limited amount of time to reach the end point.</li>
      <li>Lives: The game can have a limited number of lives, so that if the player runs into a wall or gets caught by an obstacle, they lose a life. If the player loses all of their lives, the game is over.</li>
      <li>Scoring: The game can be scored based on how quickly the player reaches the end point or how many lives they have remaining at the end of the game.</li>
      <li>Restart: The game can be restarted if the player wants to play again.</li>
    </ul>
